# Introduction
The storyline of a certain role-playing game is that a student wanted to break into the general 
office to steal the final examination paper. A security guard discovered and a combat took place 
in our general office.

# Classes
Therea are three classes to model some characters, which will enter a combat 
with each other.
There are two kinds of characters – SecurityGuard and Student. Both of them are holding laser 
guns and they will lose energy upon being attacked by laser guns. However, they have special 
features as follows:

• The SecurityGuard can call the department head to boost his/her laser gun for a stronger 
attack.

• The Student can hide himself/herself to dodge an attack.
We implement a Character class, which represents a game character in general, 
and two classes, SecurityGuard and Student, which are the subclasses of the Character class.
